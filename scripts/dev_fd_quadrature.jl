#comparing to the f0 test, where we got 1e-3 error for 10 and 13 pts for GL and CC respectively, here we have
#12 and 13 pts, respectively, and similarly, we have that it is faster
#Need to do a careful comparison at some point where we can average over a number of times,
#as it is hard to know when the quad points are reusing p/re-computed values...
#Either way so long as the computation of quadrature points (which occurs in the background once)
#plus the sum operations that happen frequently are faster than quadgk * number of times it is called,
#then we are fine - and I think this is an easily attainable threshold for a small number of quad pts (<15)

#Would be interesting to see if cosmology affects this accuracy, because could reduce cost even further by
#just passing the q-pts (computed externally) once instead of computing in bg

#hmm I forgot a factor of q before, but even at higher redshift the performance
#is about the same on 15 pts, only around 1e-3 rerr
