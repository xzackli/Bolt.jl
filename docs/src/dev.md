## Conventions
This package works in Planck units, i.e.

``c = ħ = ϵ₀ = k_B = 1``

Note that `G ≠ 1`.

Conventionally, any scalar function of time, such as `\eta`, takes as input the logarithm of the scale factor `x ≡ log(a)`. Any scalar function of time which does not operate on `x` must be marked with an underscore for the variable it does take, for example `H_a`.
